**originalData:** This object array contains the original data from the JSON file. It's the source of truth for the problems as they were loaded from the file. This array should remain unchanged and pure, reflecting the exact data structure and content as it was in the JSON file.
**userProblems**: This object array is used to keep track of the state of each problem as the user interacts with them. It's a modified version of the original data, where each problem record is updated with information about the user's interaction, such as whether the problem has been solved, the number of attempts, and so on. This array is dynamic and changes as the user progresses through the problems.
The key point here is that `originalData` is used to maintain the integrity and original state of the problems, while `userProblems` is used to track the user's progress and interaction with those problems. This separation allows you to keep the original data intact while also having a flexible system to manage the user's state and progress.

Maintaining these two separate arrays is a good way for managing state in a dynamic application. It ensures that the original data remains unchanged and can be used for reference or to reset the state of the application, while `originalData` provides the flexibility needed to track and manage the user's interaction with the problems.
