Dynamic Content Loading: Your current setup loads all problems at once. If you have a large dataset, consider loading problems dynamically as the user progresses through them to improve performance.

Progress Tracking: Implement a way to track the user's progress through the problems. This could involve updating a progress bar or displaying the number of problems solved.

Data Validation: Before processing user input or executing code, validate the data to ensure it meets your expectations. This can prevent runtime errors and improve the security of your application.
